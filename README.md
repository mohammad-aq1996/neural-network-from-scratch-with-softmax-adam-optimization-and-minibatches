<h2 align=center> Implementing Neural Network from scratch with Numpy </h2>
<h4> 
In this project I used the fashion mnist 10 class dataset. 
<br>
  I used a 3 layer Neural Network, He initialization, random minibatch with the size of 16, softmax activation for output layer and Adam optimization algorithm. I implemented all of those algorithms with Numpy
